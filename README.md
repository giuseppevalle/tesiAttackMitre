# tesiAttackMitre
This is the work realised for my Bachelor thesis. It has the goal of creating a databasea based on the data provided by ATT&CK knowledge. Then some queries have been done to to prove its efficiency

## Description
Starting from the knowledge of ATT & CK, I realized a program written in java through which it was possible to generate and operate on a database. The latter allowed to check and understand how it is possible to defend against cyber attacks. It is also possible to ask the database for information about the tactics used and their mitigation.
